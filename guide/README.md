# Entertainment Guide
Angular app built to experiment with api calls to Gracenote entertainment services.

Search movie by zip code.

See local tv listings for sports broadcasts.

Schedule of movies on tv is also available and will be implemented.

Currently I'm working within the limitations of the free account. But I may be able to add other features, like movie poster images and search for tv channel lineups.

In progress:
add filter to movies
click on movies to get more info?
